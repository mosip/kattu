# Tagging of Repos Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow automates the process of creating GitHub releases by applying `tags` to your repositories.
It provides the flexibility to create both regular releases and pre-releases while allowing you to customize the release's body message.
The workflow can be triggered based on your specific release criteria.

## Inputs

The workflow accepts the following inputs:
- `TAG` (required): The tag that you want to create and publish.
- `BODY` (optional, default: 'Changes in this Release'): A custom message for the release body, describing the changes in this release.
- `PRE_RELEASE` (required, default: False): A boolean (True/False) indicating whether the release is a pre-release or not.
- `DRAFT` (optional, default: False): A boolean (True/False) indicating whether the release should be a draft.

## Secrets

This workflow requires the following secrets to be set in your GitHub repository:
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (required): The Slack webhook URL for sending notifications about the workflow's progress and outcome.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use this workflow to create a release:
```yaml
